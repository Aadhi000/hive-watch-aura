# This would be an audio file in a real implementation
# For demo purposes, the app generates alert sounds using Web Audio API
# To add a real alert.mp3 file:
# 1. Record or download an alert sound
# 2. Place it in the public folder as alert.mp3
# 3. The app will automatically use it for notifications
